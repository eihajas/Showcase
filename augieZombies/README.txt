Welcome to Augie Zombies!

This is a text-based zombie survival simulator that takes place on my college
campus. It is a work in progress so bear with me please.

UPDATE (11/25/2022)
I have the bare bones of what I the combat system to be. The player can choose to rest
or explore. Choosing explore has a chance to lead to a successful exploration 
or encountering a zombie. Upon encountering a zombie, the player can fight or
flight. Fight leads to an automatic fight that either kills the player or zombie
Flight leads to the player avoiding the fight.

TO ADD NEXT
Implement the bare bones of the movement system and merge it with the combat
system.
